## What is Bitalk?

Bitalk is a revolutionary social discovery app that helps you find and connect with like-minded people in your immediate vicinity!

Whether you're at a coffee shop, conference, concert, or just walking around town, Bitalk uses **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** to create a private mesh network that connects you with interesting people nearby - all without needing internet, GPS tracking, or sharing your personal data with big tech companies!

## Why Bitalk

In our hyper-connected yet paradoxically isolated world, I believe the most meaningful connections happen **face-to-face** with people who share your interests. But how do you discover these kindred spirits in a crowded room or bustling city?
Bitalk helps you find people who have the same interests as you.

## How Bitalk Works

### 1. **Choose your topics**
Select from dozens of interesting topics or create your own! From "Bitcoin" and "Art" to "Hiking" and "Startups" - let people know what makes you tick.

### 2. **Describe yourself**
Add a quick description to help others identify you: "Guy in the yellow shirt by the coffee counter" or "Woman with the cool vintage backpack"

### 3. **Start discovering**
Bitalk automatically scans for nearby people using Bluetooth. When someone with matching interests comes within range, you'll see them appear as a bubble on your screen!

### 4. **Connect & talk**
Tap on someone's bubble to see their full profile, shared interests, and how long they've been nearby. If you vibe with their topics, approach them for a real conversation!

## Key features

### **Smart topic matching**
- **Partial matching**: "Art" matches "Digital Art", "Street Art", etc.
- **Exact matching**: Only match identical topics for more precise connections
- **Custom topics**: Create your own topics that others can discover and match with

### **Intuitive interface** 
- **Bubble visualization**: See people as floating bubbles - bigger bubbles mean they're closer!
- **Distance indicators**: "Very Close", "Close", "Far" - know exactly how near someone is
- **Real-time updates**: Watch as people move in and out of range

### **Smart notifications**
Get instant alerts when someone with matching interests enters your vicinity:
*"Found match: Nostr, Startups - alice: Woman in red jacket with many pins"*

### **Privacy & security**
- **Zero internet required** - works completely offline!
- **No GPS tracking** - only uses Bluetooth proximity
- **No personal data collection** - everything stays on your device  
- **No account required** - just pick a username and you're ready!
- **Ephemeral connections** - people disappear when they're no longer nearby
- **Hyper-local discovery** - only shows people within Bluetooth range (~30 meters)
- **Completely decentralized** - no central servers or corporate surveillance
